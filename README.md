Thuislab
========

The goal is to setup a homelab/homeserver for experimenting virtualisation and containerisation technologies. The homelab will provide IoT, CI and Media services on a geographically distributed network (me and my parents home). The intention is to create a as stateless configuration as possible which can be provisioned completely with configuration from this repository.

- HP Microserver Gen8
- Raspberry Pies
- Mikrotik routers

Layout:
